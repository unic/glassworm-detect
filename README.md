# Glassworm Extension Detection Tool

A bash script to detect and remove malicious VSCode extensions affected by the **Glassworm** supply chain attack (October 2025).

## What is Glassworm?

Glassworm is a supply chain attack that compromised multiple VSCode extensions on both the OpenVSX and Microsoft VSCode marketplaces. The malicious versions of these extensions contained code that could:

- Execute arbitrary commands on the host system
- Steal sensitive data including credentials
- Establish persistent backdoors
- Exfiltrate source code and project files

## Affected Extensions

This tool checks for the following malicious extensions and their compromised versions, according to [https://www.koi.ai/blog/glassworm-first-self-propagating-worm-using-invisible-code-hits-openvsx-marketplace](https://www.koi.ai/blog/glassworm-first-self-propagating-worm-using-invisible-code-hits-openvsx-marketplace)

### OpenVSX Extensions

- `codejoy.codejoy-vscode-extension` @ 1.8.3, 1.8.4
- `l-igh-t.vscode-theme-seti-folder` @ 1.2.3
- `kleinesfilmroellchen.serenity-dsl-syntaxhighlight` @ 0.3.2
- `JScearcy.rust-doc-viewer` @ 4.2.1
- `SIRILMP.dark-theme-sm` @ 3.11.4
- `CodeInKlingon.git-worktree-menu` @ 1.0.9, 1.0.91
- `ginfuru.better-nunjucks` @ 0.3.2
- `ellacrity.recoil` @ 0.7.4
- `grrrck.positron-plus-1-e` @ 0.0.71
- `jeronimoekerdt.color-picker-universal` @ 2.8.91
- `srcery-colors.srcery-colors` @ 0.3.9
- `sissel.shopify-liquid` @ 4.0.1
- `TretinV3.forts-api-extention` @ 0.3.1

### Microsoft VSCode Extensions

- `cline-ai-main.cline-ai-agent` @ 3.1.3

## Requirements

- **Bash 4.0+** (the script uses associative arrays)
- **macOS/Linux** operating system
- VSCode, VSCode Insiders, or VSCodium installed (optional - script will check all)

### Checking Your Bash Version

```bash
bash --version
```

On macOS, the default `/bin/bash` is version 3.2. If you need to upgrade:

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install bash

# Verify installation
/usr/local/bin/bash --version
```

The script uses `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to automatically use the newer version if available.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unic/glassworm-detect
   ```

2. **Make the script executable** (if not already):

   ```bash
   chmod +x glassworm-detect.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   ./glassworm-detect.sh
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts** - if infected extensions are found, you'll be asked whether to uninstall them.

### What the Script Does

The script will:

1. ‚úÖ **Scan all VSCode installations** on your system:

   - Visual Studio Code (`code`)
   - Visual Studio Code Insiders (`code-insiders`)
   - VSCodium (`codium`)

2. üîç **Check all installed extensions** against the known malicious list

3. üìä **Report findings** with color-coded output:

   - üü¢ Green = Clean/Safe
   - üü° Yellow = Warnings
   - üî¥ Red = Infected extensions found

4. üóëÔ∏è **Offer to uninstall** any infected extensions (with confirmation)

5. üìù **Generate a log file** with scan results (timestamped)

### Exit Codes

The script returns meaningful exit codes for automation:

- `0` - Clean system, no infections found
- `1` - Infected extensions detected

This allows you to use it in scripts:

```bash
if ./glassworm-detect.sh; then
    echo "System is clean"
else
    echo "Infections found - please review"
fi
```

## How It Works

### Detection Process

1. **Discovery Phase**

   - Checks for available VSCode installations using `command -v`
   - Stores found installations for reporting

2. **Scanning Phase**

   - For each VSCode installation, runs: `code --list-extensions --show-versions`
   - Parses the output to extract extension IDs and version numbers
   - Compares each installed extension against the malicious extensions database

3. **Matching Phase**

   - Checks both the extension ID (publisher.name) and specific version number
   - Only flags extensions that match BOTH the ID and a known malicious version
   - Safe versions of the same extension are not flagged

4. **Reporting Phase**

   - Displays all findings with clear visual indicators
   - Warns if multiple VSCode installations are present
   - Creates a timestamped log file for auditing

5. **Remediation Phase** (optional)
   - Prompts user for each infected extension
   - Executes `code --uninstall-extension <id>` for confirmed removals
   - Reports success/failure of each uninstall operation

### Log Files

Each scan creates a log file named: `glassworm-scan-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`

The log contains:

- Scan timestamp
- User who ran the scan
- VSCode installations found
- List of infected extensions (if any)

## Example Output

## Security Recommendations

If the script detects infected extensions, you should:

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚úÖ **Uninstall all infected extensions** (script offers to do this)
2. üîê **Change passwords** for:
   - GitHub/GitLab accounts
   - Cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Email accounts
   - Any credentials stored in your projects
3. üîÑ **Rotate API keys and tokens**
4. üîç **Review recent activity** in your repositories and cloud accounts

### Follow-Up Actions

1. üõ°Ô∏è **Run security scans**:
   - Full system antivirus scan
   - Rootkit detection tools
   - Network traffic monitoring
2. üìä **Check logs** for:
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Unusual file modifications
   - Suspicious network connections
3. üîî **Enable 2FA** on all critical accounts if not already enabled
4. üíæ **Review backups** - ensure they're not compromised
5. üë• **Inform your team** if working in a shared environment

## Limitations

- **Version-specific detection**: Only flags the exact malicious versions listed
- **User scope only**: Checks extensions for the current user only
- **Installed versions only**: Cannot detect extensions that were installed and removed
- **System extensions**: May not detect system-wide installed extensions
- **Manual installation**: Cannot detect manually installed extensions (not via marketplace)

## Contributing

If you discover additional compromised extensions or versions, please update the `MALICIOUS_EXTENSIONS` associative array in the script:

```bash
MALICIOUS_EXTENSIONS["publisher.extension-name"]="version1 version2"
```
